# ImplicitCF_TF_implementation

This notebook implemented implicit collaborative filtering using the steam video games dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games). I also attempted to introduce the concept of inmplicit collaborative filtering throughout the notebook. 

Some of the limitation mentioned in the notebook was due to the constrained environment of Kaggle's kernel.
